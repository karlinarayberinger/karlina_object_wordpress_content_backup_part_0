<p><strong>Axioms</strong></p>
<p>Let PERSON be a data object template which represents exactly one unique human instance (whether than humanoid is alive or else dead).</p>
<p>Let MIND be a data object template which represents exactly one unique universe instance (which contains all instances of PERSON simultaneously).</p>
<p>Let Z be some finite instance of MIND (which is constrained to at least two subjective perspectives: X and Y).</p>
<p>Let X and Y each be PERSON objects which interact with each other inside of the same contextual instance of MIND, Z.</p>
<p>Set X to have more importance with respect to Z than Y does by implementing the instruction, Z.promote_former_demote_latter(X,Y).</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<p>It can be assumed that X will get more time to broadcast its thoughts through Z than will Y.</p>
<p>In other words, X.total_thought_transmission is a higher number than is Y.total_thought_transmission.</p>
<p>Not only does X get to use up more bandwidth inside of Z at any given point in time than is Y, X is also more likely to have a stable and robust identity established inside of Z&#8217;s long-term memory than is Y due to finite resource allocation which is deterministically constrained by the prioritization rules decided by Z for the autonomous dynamic closed-system of perpetual information flow which is Z.</p>
