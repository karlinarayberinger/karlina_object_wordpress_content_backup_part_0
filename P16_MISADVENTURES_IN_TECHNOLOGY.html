<p>The following anecdotes provide a minimal amount of tangible context for why I am more of a nomadic tech worker instead of a relatively stationary (i.e. office-bound, corporation-directed, culturally-appropriated) tech worker…</p>
<p>On 19_MARCH_2020, I spent the night under a bridge (which was a part of the Iron Horse trail about a quarter mile away from the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station). While I was camping there, I made a video recording of the cacophony of croaking frogs in my midst (which I later used to create the following 11-second audio file: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_wordpress_content_backup_part_0/main/frog_choir_noise_sample.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_wordpress_content_backup_part_0/main/frog_choir_noise_sample.mp3</a>).</p>
<p>On 16_NOVEMBER_2020, I hiked from the Daly City BART station down to Ocean Beach where I recorded a video of the water waves crashing against the sand in a slow rhythmic pattern (which I later used to create the following 33-second audio file: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_wordpress_content_backup_part_0/main/sea_and_sand_noise_sample.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_wordpress_content_backup_part_0/main/sea_and_sand_noise_sample.mp3</a>).</p>
<p>The two aforementioned audio files are the only “preloaded” audio file options which are included in the following single page web application used for looping audio tracks and for counting the number of times a selected audio track is played (and for how many seconds that particular audio track is played in total). The documentation and component files for that software application are available at the following page of this website: <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/infinite_loop_sound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/infinite_loop_sound/</a>.</p>
<p>What drew me into computer science as a college major in 2010 was not the prospect of eventually obtaining a lucrative and prestigious career, but rather, a lifelong obsession with philosophically analyzing the boundaries between the physical and the virtual. (Needless to say, I have not completed my undergraduate studies in computer science at California State University East Bay because I became jaded by the creativity-dampening bureaucracy of the corporate world which seems to venerate the information technology sector as some kind of exclusive clique whose membership requires the sponsorship of a rich angel investor. Also, I ran out of funds to enroll in classes (and I am on academic probation due to my earning of shitty grades)).</p>

<p>While perusing the annals of Archive dot Org in search of “buried” fragments of my past Internet-based identities, I excavated the following digital artifacts from the blogs which I backed up on Archive dot Org’s WayBack Machine but have since deleted from their respective WordPress dot Com servers:</p>

The picture I shot was taken while I was high on marijuana edibles and, therefore, a bit enshrouded inside my own “inside joke” of a thought bubble which I arrogantly assumed was obvious to the outside world. At this time, I have trouble remembering exactly what I was trying to express that day.</p>

<p>(As an aside, this image particularly seems to have some otherworldly, almost divine-like quality to it such that the image seems to evoke more meaning for me now than it did the day I drew it. (Perhaps a future or parallel version of myself snuck into my limited vantage in order to help me uncover mysteries about the non-linearity of time and the non-uniformity of space by delivering insights from beyond my finite studio location). I remember being a bit depressed about mortality yet, simultaneously, exquisitely and ecstatically inspired by existentialism at the same time when I drew it. After I drew that image, I retreated into the woods near my house at Lake Chabot Regional Park).</p>

<p>The following text-only journal entry is a very good example of the kinds of abstract logical axioms I have always been intrigued by. The journal entry is a decent introduction to the melding of epistemology and computer science:</p>
<p>A: “0 is 0”.</p>
<p>A’: “A implies that 0 is a symbol referring to itself”.</p>
<p>B: “0 is not 0”.</p>
<p>B’: “B implies that 0 is a token and not a symbol referring to itself”.</p>
<p>C: “NOT(0) : 1 :: NOT(1) : 0”.</p>
<p>C’: “C implies that the token 0 is the sole counterpart to the token 1 and vice versa”.</p>
<p>D: “0 precedes 1 while 1 exceeds 0”.</p>
<p>D’: “If 0 and 1 are each symbols representing distinct quantities, then 0 represents a smaller quantity than what 1 represents. At the same time, 1 represents a larger quantity than what 0 represents”.</p>
