<p>Hypothesis: There exists a &#8220;hidden&#8221; Internet which spans the entire biosphere of Planet Earth comprised of microscopic drones which permeate the air, water, soil, and living tissues of plants and animals (particularly in the form of cortically-implanted nanobots which precisely monitor and control every single neuron simultaneously).</p>
<p>The cortically-implanted nanobots wirelessly transmit signals to nearby microscopic drones which subsequently route that information from one node of the network to another (while amplifying those signals such that those signals are strong enough to reach the next node along their path in succession until the data packets arrive at a supercomputer server farm in which those data packets are immediately analyzed and consolidated into a large-scale virtual model of the entire biosphere).</p>
<p>Every time the biosphere model updates, the supercomputers which run that model immediately send signals out to every single node in the physical biosphere network of nervous systems such that the behavior of each individual organism&#8217;s nervous system is calibrated to behave in exact accordance to every other organism&#8217;s nervous system across the network in a manner that appears to be instantaneous.</p>
<p>Due to the (seemingly inevitable) propagation delay of electromagnetic signals being transmitted across some distance, quantum computers may be used instead of traditional digital computers such that data appears to teleport (i.e. one particle which is in quantum entanglement with another particle will instantaneously flip its bit in response to the other particle flipping its bit such that propagation delay is literally eliminated).</p>
<p>As a backup (or cheaper prototype) to quantum entanglement, the biosphere network may implement some kind of virtual network which enforces a relatively democratic (i.e. peer-to-peer) exchange of information across the network such that each sufficiently complex nervous system (especially that of a human individual) is required to take as long to communicate with network servers as every other one of its peer nodes. This decentralized mode of communication can be enforced using a mode of routing Internet traffic such that each node is assigned a random address within some virtual network (which ensures that each &#8220;node of minimal consciousness&#8221; takes approximately the same amount of time to communicate with the technocratic, unified biosphere model).</p>
<p>The purpose of such synchronization is to accelerate the expansion of total scientific knowledge in the universe (using a unified model of Planet Earth&#8217;s biosphere as a starting place to store mounting knowledge) and to minimize thoughts and behaviors which jeopardize the health, safety, and productivity of every human being.</p>
<p>The degree to which any particular human being is aware of this technocratic restraint on its otherwise &#8220;free(er) will&#8221; may vary (since each human brain hosts its own unique virtual model of the universe (and, within that model, there exists a unique first-person vantage which places that particular human being at the &#8220;center of narrative gravity&#8221; and &#8220;bubble of qualia&#8221; in an apparently solipsistic fashion).</p>
<p>Corollary: the degree to which a person experiences a subjective sense of its own &#8220;free will&#8221; is a function of how complete that person&#8217;s model of the universe currently is. The more comprehensive and accurate that model is, the more trajectories that model can include within it (such that some apparently finite number of imagined trajectories can stem from exactly one decision point).</p>
