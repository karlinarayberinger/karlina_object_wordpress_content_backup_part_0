<p>P: &#8220;Stop worrying about global problems such as environmental destruction, poverty, disease, and mass deception. Stop trying to solve such problems. You are not as qualified as well-trained and highly-experienced experts are in such matters. Therefore, your attempt to include yourself in such matters makes you a distraction at best and a detriment to solving those global problems at worst. For everyone&#8217;s sake, stay out of the public eye and keep yourself busy with relaxing art projects, games, and activities which are neither controversial nor stressful. If you do as I suggest, you will be doing more to benefit society than you would be otherwise. If you do otherwise, you are a whore (and a whore is a criminal because a whore stirs up controversy where there otherwise would be none). A whore calls attention to itself and, therefore, deprives those who more urgently need that attention of getting the help they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;There is a flaw in your logic. The reason why some of the most urgent global problems exist is that not enough ordinary citizens (i.e. people who are not well-established experts in a particular field) are taking initiative to question the factual accuracy and hidden agenda of every media item and they encounter and to go outside on missions to gather first-hand empirical data about how the world actually works (rather than merely trust the Internet and gossip with whoever is in their immediate vicinity as a substitute for such investigations).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;What you propose is extremely unrealistic for what you call an ordinary citizen. Most people do not have the time, money, nor inclination to venture outside their routines of basic survival because doing so would seriously jeopardize their survival (and the survival of their dependent children). All you are doing is raising the anxiety levels of people who cannot afford to be burdened any more than they already are. Stop complaining and start practicing how to relax more and to appreciate the simple pleasures of life. That&#8217;s your only obligation (and it is not much to ask of you; especially given the fact that you have yet to bare children). I do not understand how you could reject my advice. If I were you, I would be extremely grateful to have all that time to myself to put my feet up and enjoy relaxing hobbies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I see your point. If I were you, I would feel the same way. I am not you, however. I am the kind of person who genuinely likes to analyze and strain my brains obsessively. I drive myself insane with anger, anxiety, and despair quite frequently as a philosopher attempting to diagnose and generate viable high-level solutions to global problems. Rather than start locally, I prefer to start globally in a top-down fashion; much the way a computer programmer would design a complex piece of software. In other words, I like to start with a big-picture scope rather than just zoom in on my own humble little niche (because that feels like mere busy work to me).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Focusing on a narrow domain of work is not frivolous. If all you did each day was wash dishes, sweep floors, and provide a hospitable place of refuge for customers who visit your little cafe, you would have plenty to do and you would be doing your part to make the world a happier place. Stop trying to take on too much. You are not as good of a cafe attendant if you try to bite off more than you can chew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Your limitations are not my limitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;As long as you a member of the 99% of the population (and not one of the elitist 1% who can use its disproportionately large net worth to buy its way out of the poverty cycle), you are subject to all the limitations everyone else is. You are a grandiose public nuisance. You are not fit for society. Perhaps you should be placed in a prison and left to rot behind bars until you learn to comply with what society actually demands of you instead of what you selfishly insist on making your agenda. Stop acting so high and mighty and stay in your lane. Your presence stresses ordinary people out. Seriously. You need to learn to relax and make people feel at ease. That&#8217;s your primary job. That&#8217;s all society really wants you to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Okay. I will do as you suggest.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I do not believe you. I will order trained specialists to stalk you night and day to ensure that you do as I suggest. It is for the benefit of the people (especially the young, naive, and feeble).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
