<p>P: &#8220;My goal is to maximize the intensity of my happiness and, also, my goal is to maximize the frequency and the duration of the time intervals in which I feel intensely happy. Therefore, I will do everything in my power to avoid encountering unpleasant stimuli. I will also promote the widespread use of dysphoria-blocking drugs which government-approved pharmaceutical companies advertise, sell, and liberally prescribe to the general public so that the net happiness in the world is maximized. In other words, I just want everyone to be happy and to get along with minimal conflict, strife, and malaise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;My goal is to promote curiosity and an insatiable desire to seek truthful answers to questions which science continuously (and eternally) seeks to answer (since there will presumably never be a shortage of questions to answer and uncharted territory to discover).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Your goal sounds exhausting and less than unconditionally euphoric. I would rather promote the idea of not having to know the answers to all questions. That way, people can learn to be content with what they already have rather than squander it as they toil away in pursuit of more information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I see. What do you intend to do besides sit in your lawn chair and enjoy your mug of beer and smoke your cigarettes?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Nothing. Unlike you, I am in no rush to change my circumstances nor to update my worldview. The worldview I have makes me feel good enough as it is. My worldview gives me permission to not have to feel like a failure at life since all my goals are very modest and guaranteed to be achieved. I will only make as little effort as I think is necessary to maintain homeostasis. The government and my family give me all the support I need to stay reasonably content at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Are you worried that drinking that beer along with your pharmaceutical drugs is going to damage your liver? Are you worried that smoking all those cigarettes is going to damage your respiratory and cardiovascular system? Are you worried that your second-hand smoke is going to harm the bodies of the children next door?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;No, no, and no. The children seem fine. They are not complaining. Only you are. You are the only one who seems to be unhappy in this neighborhood. I suggest you pack your bags and move out if you do not want to go with the flow of how we do things here. We do not want to host people who only seem to complain and drama monger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I am not trying to escalate the degree of discord in this neighborhood. I am just trying to call attention to the fact that the mandate to exclude anything but happy emotions and lackadaisical thoughts is stunting everyone&#8217;s intellectual growth, physiological health, and ecological stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You worry too much. I think you have paranoid personality disorder. If I can get enough members of the local community to agree with me, we can have you committed to a psychiatric ward where you will be forcibly administered thought-stopping, affect-blunting drugs which make you easier for us to live with so that you can return home and be a welcome member of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I would rather move out than settle for your community standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I am leaving now. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Q found an oasis of (relatively) free thought in an underground Internet hub. Q publishes the following message on its personal website with the intent of sharing it with as many people as possible (and without restriction)&#8230;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Even if a government codifies every citizen&#8217;s unconditional right to formulate its own opinions and to communicate those opinions in public forums (especially through the medium of personal websites whose pages are visible to any terminal of the World Wide Web), there is no guarantee that such a right is universally upheld. There is no guarantee that communications are immune to partial or total censorship such that those communications are prevented from reaching their intended audience. There is no guarantee that any message is factually correct nor unchanged from the way the author of that message originally intended for that message to be composed (and shared). It is therefore advised that every citizen exercise constant skepticism about every message received for that reason. The more people there are independently and collaboratively investigating the fairness, accuracy, and reliability of communications networks, the less likely censorship will impede the otherwise unrestricted flow of information. Even &#8216;bad&#8217; ideas (i.e. ideas which are factually inaccurate or emotionally distressing to some audiences) deserve to be shared publicly such that as many people as possible can &#8216;peer review&#8217; those ideas and contribute feedback which helps to give otherwise missing context to such ideas (and thereby maximizing the chance that the average level of intelligence across the world will be maximally high). Though it is always possible that some audiences may be harmed by consuming &#8216;bad information&#8217;, suppressing the flow of &#8216;bad information&#8217; is the antithesis of free speech. Without free speech, citizens are rendered children whose limitations of maturity are defined arbitrarily by less-than-democratic oligarchies which attempt to restrict the flow of information in ways that are almost guaranteed to favor the agenda of the oligarchs at the expense of the general public welfare. Network neutrality is necessary in order to prevent such imbalances of social power (and the abuses that follow from imbalances of social power (because, the more a person knows, the more influence that person has over its circumstances with respect to society). Network neutrality is the quality of the World Wide Web being a forum in which every citizen is equally permitted to send and to receive information across the Internet. <span style="background:#ffff00;">It is better to minimize restrictions on such communications because malicious activity will be easier to detect and to resolve if all Internet traffic is transparent to the public (except for account login credentials and the data associated with such accounts (since such data is supposed to remain obscured from the public in order to prevent theft and modification to records which are NOT art, but rather, personal logistics (which need not be public unless the owner of such personal information decides to voluntarily share that information with the public rather than keep that data visible to just the endpoints and authenticating &#8220;middlemen&#8221; of such communications))</span>. The Internet belongs to everyone simultaneously. It was not designed to be privatized.&#8221;</p>
