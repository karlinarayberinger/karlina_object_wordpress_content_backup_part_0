<p>TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;Turing Complete&#8221; is a technical term which is used to categorize some logical framework as a closed system which contains all the programmatic instructions and computational resources that system needs to do virtually anything.</p>
<p>The following tenets comprise what I believe is the most &#8220;Turing Complete&#8221; religion in all existence.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ONTOLOGICAL AXIOMS</strong></p>
<p>TENET_0: There is exactly one all-encompassing reality which consists of a ubiquitous field of pure potential (devoid of features) which can spontaneously erupt phenomena (including the space-time containers which render each of those phenomena as finite frames of reference).</p>
<p>TENET_1: There is exactly one all-encompassing reality which contains every frame of reference simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>ETHICAL AXIOMS</strong></p>
<p>TENET_2: The purpose of inhabiting a particular frame of reference is to (attempt to) make that frame of reference as omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent as possible (and to therefore transcend mortality and all other physical limitations).</p>
<p>TENET_3: The primary condition which distinguishes good behavior from bad behavior (which are committed by an information processing entity) is the fact that the behavior, if good, actively minimizes the net suffering within reality (especially within the scope of the information processing entity&#8217;s personal frame of reference).</p>
