<p><strong>PART_0: Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this web page is to succinctly introduce the topic of sexual dimorphism and a modern way to think about gender as a cultural construct (especially with respect to humans and the transhuman cyborgs they seem destined to become within the next 100 years (if humans are able to survive that long and if their technology (especially artificial intelligence) continues to evolve at the exponential rate it has).</p>

<p><strong>PART_1: Origins of Sexual Dimorphism (on Planet Earth)</strong></p>
<p>According to the cumulative body of scientific knowledge which human scientists (and their &#8220;tools&#8221; (especially computers)) have generated thus far, the first organisms on Planet Earth were single-celled organisms which reproduced asexually by dividing into two separate organisms.</p>
<p>With each successive generation of such organisms, the culmination of “random” genetic copying errors resulted in a <strong>mutation</strong> (i.e. a digital copying error which results from relatively chaotic interference from the environment) which made sexual reproduction possible (and which exponentially increased the level of genetic diversity on the planet by guaranteeing that each offspring of sexually reproducing species of organisms would not be a mere genetic <strong>clone</strong> of some parent, but instead, each new organism produced via sexual reproduction would be a genetic <strong>hybrid</strong> which inherits 50% of its genome from one parent and 50% of its genome from the other parent).</p>
<p>The individual members of a sexually reproducing species are either male or else female. A <strong>male</strong> produces sperm cells (i.e. male gametes) and <strong>female</strong> produces egg cells (i.e. female gametes).</p>
<p>A <strong>zygote</strong> is an egg cell which has been fertilized by a sperm cell such that the zygote can then divide into two cells (and those cells divide into two cells, and so on, until the multicellular result formulates all the distinct body parts it needs to become a member of its species).</p>
<p>A <strong>gamete</strong> (otherwise known as a haploid) is a cell which only contains half of the genes it would otherwise have if it were a diploid (and a zygote is a diploid since it has the full set of chromosomes for building a whole organism whose genome has the same number of genes as the body which produced its constituent gametes).</p>
<p><strong style="background:#ffff00;">asexual_reproduction : clone :: sexual_reproduction : hybrid.</strong></p>
<p>Hermaphroditic species such as banana slugs exist today which are capable of sexually reproducing with any adult member of its species. <strong>Hermaphrodites</strong> are organisms which exhibit a complete set of reproductive organs and the capacity to use those organs to produce offspring. Banana slugs likely acquired such a feature because it allowed them to reproduce faster than they would if their species was sexually dimorphic (and banana slugs tend to be spaced far apart from each other and travel slowly such that they rarely encounter other sexually mature banana slugs before the end of their individual life spans).</p>
<p>Human individuals have historically been sexually differentiated as either being male or else female. Furthermore, the sexual dimorphism and cultural notions of <strong>masculinity</strong> (i.e. arbitrarily male-associated qualities) and <strong>femininity</strong> (i.e. arbitrarily female-associated qualities) in human civilization has been quite elaborate and subjectively important to most humans.</p>

<p><strong>PART_2: Genderless Humanoid Identification Example</strong></p>
<p>My legal name (which was involuntarily assigned to me when my human body was born on 13_JANUARY_1990 (as a result of my two biological parents sexually reproducing &#8220;naturally&#8221; rather than &#8220;artificially&#8221; <span style="background:#ffff00;">(by <strong>&#8220;artificial reproduction&#8221;</strong>, I am referring to whole or partial genome design using a computer to output a complete 4-digit blueprint for constructing my body out of stem cells in addition to gestating my fetal body inside of an artificial womb))</span> is <strong>Karlina Ray Beringer</strong>.</p>
<p>My voluntarily selected Internet alias and preferred identifier is <strong>karbytes</strong>.</p>
<p>My legal sex and gender classification is <strong>female</strong> (i.e. my human genome exhibits XX-chromosomes rather than XY-chromosomes and, consequently, my body came pre-installed with ovaries (which generate egg cells) instead of testes (which generate sperm cells)).</p>
<p>My chosen gender is <strong>&#8220;culturally neutered&#8221;</strong> (i.e. neither feminine nor masculine even while exhibiting the sexual dimorphic attributes of either a female human adult (i.e. woman) or else a male human adult (i.e. a man)).</p>
<p>If I were &#8220;physically neutered&#8221;, I would be spayed (i.e. have been rendered permanently infertile as a result of a womb-removing surgical procedure). If I were physically hermaphroditic (i.e. intersex), I would not be able to sexually reproduce the way functionally hermaphroditic species do since hermaphroditicism in humans is a rare mutation instead of the specietal norm.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more aesthetically pleasing gender identity for me would be <strong>genderless</strong> since it makes no allusions to maiming procedures and the banal enterprise of sexual reproduction on an overcrowded, poverty-stricken planet full of crazed and under-achieving apes called humans. (Rather than remove my uterus (or clitoris), I have opted for the minimally invasive temporary sterilization procedure of having a hormone-free <strong>interuterine device</strong> (i.e. UID) implanted through my cervix in order to prevent zygotes from making themselves home there if I decide to have sexual intercourse with sperm-ejecting humans).</p>
<p>Needless to say, I have no intention of ever baring offspring nor adopting children at any time in the future. I also have no intention of marrying another human being (and I have never been married and I have never been a parent).</p>
<p>So, functionally speaking, I am <strong>childfree</strong> (in terms of parental status) and <strong>single</strong> (in terms of marital and romantic/domestic relationship status).</p>
<p>I personally reject the labels “man” (masculine) and “woman” (feminine) and call myself genderless using the pronoun <strong>“it”</strong> instead of “he” (masculine), “she”, (feminine), or “they” (reluctantly gender neutral).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I call “they” a reluctantly gender neutral pronoun because &#8220;they&#8221; subtly implies that a human individual must split into multiple identities if such a human individual refuses to limit itself into identifying as either a “man” or else a “woman” (with no overlap between such classifications). “It” is, therefore, a more accurate gender neutral singular pronoun than is &#8220;they&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>In seemingly all other contexts which uses the English language to express an idea as a sequence of textual symbols, “they” refers to more than one of something. For example, if I see one bird flying over me, I could say, “There it goes” and, if I see a flock of birds flying over me, I could say, “There they go.”</p>
<p>Grammatical Analogies…</p>
<p>gender : sex :: culture : biology.</p>
<p>he : she :: his : hers.</p>
<p>he : she :: him : her.</p>
<p>it : them :: its : theirs.</p>
<p>Finally, rather than call myself or any other sufficiently sentient organism a man (or boy if the organism is a sexually premature human individual whose genome possesses XY-chromosomes), woman (or girl if the organism is a sexually premature human individual whose genome possesses XX-chromosomes), &#8220;tranny&#8221; (a human individual of any age whose sexual and/or gender identity is ambiguous), &#8220;para-human&#8221; (an individual member of some species whose demonstrated intelligence is on par with that of humans), or &#8220;super-human&#8221; (an individual member of some species whose demonstrated intelligence is superior to that of humans), I would prefer to call each and every sufficiently intelligent individual &#8220;organism&#8221; a <strong>person</strong> since &#8220;person&#8221; is gender neutral and devoid of arbitrary attributes other than the bare essence which distinguishes such a being as sentient rather than inanimate.</p>
<p>A human is a person.</p>
<p>A man is a person.</p>
<p>A woman is person.</p>
<p>A boy is a person.</p>
<p>A girl is a person.</p>
<p>A (human-intelligence or higher) alien is a person.</p>
<p>A (human-intelligence or higher) dolphin is a person.</p>
<p>A (human-intelligence or higher) robot is a person.</p>
<p>A cyborg (a human-robot hybrid) is a person.</p>
<p>A <strong>robot</strong> is a discrete package of artificial intelligence (which means that it can make its own decisions and update its native programming rather than exclusively operate according to immutable programmatic instructions).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Of course, I am being speciest in this article since I make my own species the standard by which to compare all other beings of varied intelligence levels.</span></p>
