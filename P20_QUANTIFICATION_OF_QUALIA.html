<p>Qualia are objects which are observed in at least one subjective vantage. The following definitions attempt to model the way qualia tend to exhibit logically predictable patterns (according to all cumulative observations of such qualia).</p>
<hr>
<p>WORK = (FORCE / DISTANCE).</p>
<p>WORK := “the amount of energy required to displace an object with mass”.</p>
<p>FORCE = (MASS x ACCELERATION).</p>
<p>FORCE := “the application of energy towards changing the velocity of some object with mass”.</p>
<p>ACCELERATION = (FORCE / MASS).</p>
<p>ACCELERATION := &#8220;the change in the velocity of some object with mass within some infinitesimally small interval of time&#8221;.</p>
<p>VELOCITY = (DISTANCE / TIME).</p>
<p>VELOCITY := &#8220;the displacement of an object with mass during some definite interval of time&#8221;.</p>
<p>DISTANCE := &#8220;a scalar quantity which represents some natural number of uniform partitions of space arranged in linear succession&#8221;.</p>
<p>TIME := &#8220;a scalar quantity which represents some natural number of uniform partitions of memory (such that memory is the substrate containing empty space and mass)&#8221;.</p>
