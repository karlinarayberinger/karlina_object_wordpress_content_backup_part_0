<p>CONSCIOUSNESS</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SOLIPSISM:</strong> the sensory perceptions and logical conceptualizations which suggest that exactly one locus of consciousness exists.</p>
<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM:</strong> the epistemological framework which conceptualizes all phenomena (i.e. qualia) as being suspended inside of exactly one substrate made of consciousness (i.e. nothingness).</p>
<p><strong>QUALIA:</strong> an object (or group of objects) consisting of distinct and static features for some finite interval of space and time.</p>
<p><strong>NOTHINGNESS:</strong> a ubiquitous and featureless backdrop to all qualia (and permeating &#8220;substance&#8221; inside of all qualia).</p>
<p><strong>CONSCIOUSNESS:</strong> the substrate which enables this sequence of characters to be instantiated.</p>
