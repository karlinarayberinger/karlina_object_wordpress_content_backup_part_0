<p>S: &#8220;Why is money the root of all evil?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Money is scarce by design. There exists only a finite quantity of it at one time. Ideally, that quantity is not supposed to change. Of course, the demand for money historically has tended to almost always exceed its supply. Therefore, governments have been &#8216;forced&#8217; by such a demand to manufacture (i.e. mint) more money to introduce into the economic system such that the worth of a single unit of money inevitably decreases. That fluctuation in unit worth of money causes the price of goods and services to increase in order to maintain their relative value. So adding more money to the system does not functionally increase its availability; only the appearance that there is more to go around. To get to your actual question, money is the root of all evil because (a) evil is committed only by users of money and (b) by equating money with health, people can literally be rendered sick or dead by not having enough money (in societies which equate money with health). Such societies imply that a person only deserves to thrive if that person is sufficiently rich. Otherwise, that person might as well be left for dead even while resources and means to save that person&#8217;s life are left underutilized.&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Are you suggesting that a poor person steal basic necessities from stores in order to make ends meet?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Only when no other viable means are available should a person resort to theft. Yes, I am suggesting that theft is more ethical than being deprived of basic necessities. Really, the solution I am after is much more systemic, wholesome, and permanent: the introduction of a universal basic income which uses tokens whose unit value does not fluctuate. Perhaps such tokens can be based on the number of joules of energy solar cell farms yield per time year. To prevent the hoarding of tokens in too few of hands, such tokens would be distributed to those who need it exactly at the time they need it with minimal delay (and if there is any left over tokens after a certain cyclical time period elapses, those surplus tokens will automatically be withdrawn from the user&#8217;s token bank and sent back to the community pool).&#8221;</p>
