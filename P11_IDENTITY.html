<p>A Person is a network of concepts and memories (however distorted and informationally complete those memories are) distributed across multiple information-processing nodes and communication channels between such nodes.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is possible for the components of a Person (which is essentially a software object) to be edited, deleted, or newly generated such that Person X is X at one point in time and Y at a different point in time (depending on which arbitrarily discernible features are arbitrarily selected in order to differentiate X from Y and vice versa).</p>
<hr>
<p>Let A and B be distinct Person instances which are allocations of the same finite space-time continuum.</p>
<p>Let i be a nonnegative integer which is initially set to 0 and which is incremented by exactly 1 per iteration of process P(A,B,i) until i equals N (some &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; number).</p>
<p>Let P(A,B,i) be the process of swapping the ith trait of A with the ith trait of B such that exactly one trait is altered in both Person instances at time i.</p>
<p>Run the process P(A,B,i) for a total of N times, starting at time i = 0.</p>
<p>Then, if A.part(i) is swapped with B.part(i) until i = N, A and B would phenotypically resemble the other Person such that A at time i = N appears to be completely identical to B at time i = 0 and such that B at time i = N appears to be completely identical to A at time i = 0.</p>
<p>In other words, after the piece-by-piece trading of identifying traits between A and B is complete, A and B appear to be have completely foreign contents. The only thing that seems to remain unchanged in A and B is each of those Person object&#8217;s apparently unbroken continuity of existence as a featureless container &#8220;composed of&#8221; some finite void suspended inside of the &#8220;substrate&#8221; of space-time.</p>
