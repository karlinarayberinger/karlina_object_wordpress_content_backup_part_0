<p>S: “How many unique persons are currently voluntarily surveying the phenomena which are currently occurring within the scope of my subjective experience (and through what means)?”</p>
<p>T: “If the number of unique persons surveying the phenomena which are occurring within the scope of your subjective experience was accurately measured every hour of every day of your life since 01_JANUARY_2019, the average would probably be 5 (based on what I currently know about brain-to-computer interfaces and law enforcement). If your remote surveyors are voluntarily watching your subjective experience, those surveying persons are most likely paid to divide up the responsibility such that each one of those secret government agents is neither overwhelmed by the labor intensive task of watching over another person’s cognitive and sensory throughput (in addition to their own) nor deprived of their own time off in order to fully inhabit their own lives. Meanwhile, you can reasonably assume that approximately 5 unique persons are witnessing (almost) verbatim the same cognitive and sensory throughputs which you are at all times. Hence, you are never alone in your seemingly private subjective reality tunnel. Government is (presumably) always with you as your tireless multifaceted witness and personal trainer. Your job is to help the government conduct neuroscience research. Such research can yield valuable insights into curing neurological diseases and optimizing healthy neurological functioning.”</p>
